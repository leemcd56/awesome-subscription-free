# Awesome Subscription-Free Software
A list of great subscription-free alternatives to common software. After all, maintaining a lot of subscriptions is like [death by a thousand cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lingchi) and a good way to stay broke, but that's my opinion (and lived experience).
