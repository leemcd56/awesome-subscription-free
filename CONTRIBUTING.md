# Contributing

To add software to this list, it must either be completely free _or_ meet the following criteria:

1. Have the option to purchase a perpetual or "lifetime" license.
2. The option to purchase said license *must not be hidden* and be easily accessible.
3. Must be able to purchase for individual use.
4. Cannot be an operating system (that would be a long list).

## Do's and Don'ts

- ✅ _Do_ fork this repository and add software.
- ✅ _Do_ use `npx awesome-lint` to validate your contribution.
- ✅ _Do_ add software and its pricing model under the software it's an alternative to.
- ✅ _Do_ create a PR with a succinct title.
  - **Acceptable:** "Added Acme.inc" and "Removed Acme.inc"
  - **Unacceptable:** "PR for adding Acme.inc as an alternative to Foo Bar"
- ❌ _Don't_ use draft PRs.
- ❌ _Don't_ open issues.
- ❌ _Don't_ threaten me or any contributors for adding your software.
- ❌ _Don't_ remove your software from this list for any reason (competition is the idea here).
